A truth about re-rendering
-----------------------------


If you have multiple components inside current component, and current component re-renders,
irrespective of whether sub-components depend on the `changing state or not, the sub-components 
are still re-rendered!

E.g.

<App> 
    [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
    
    <Header />
    <Counter count = {counter} />
    <Footer>

</App>

> Here, all 3 subcomponents re-render even though only Counter depends on 'counter' state.
